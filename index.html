                <p>Our project has a few core elements. By logging in using the 426 backend provided to us,
                    you will be able to add your favorite sports teams to the web page (akin to ESPN but with more
                    flexibility). From that point, each team will be stored in it's own tile. These tiles will be able to
                    show various things about the team (schedule, record, news, scores) but each of these things will
                    be customizable by the user. The tiles will also be able to be dragged around on the page, resized, 
                    and saved to their account. Below is a rough mockup of this idea.

                but I just added them here for the purposes of the mockup -->
