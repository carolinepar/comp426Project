# comp426Project

426sport is a website that provides a forum to users who are passionate in sports, so that they have one specific place to discuss, argue, and rant about their sport-related opinions. Its functionality includes creating posts, as well as editing or deleting them if they are the user's; viewing others' posts; commenting and biewing others' comments; saving posts to come back to later; a page that displays all saved posts and all posts the user has created; a page to view upcoming sporting events in different leagues so the user knows what is coming up soon in different leagues.
