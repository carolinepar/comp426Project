        <!--
                Instead of doing a table (which i wrote out below), it might be mroe effective 
                to have a side nav bar of all the user's fave teams, 
                and then the actual content will display the team's stats. 
                When no team is selected, the main content will be blank 
                or will display a message that says "Choose a team to see its statistics"

                This way we don't need to worry about making a new page for each 
                team -- we can hide all content, and when a new team is selected 
                any old content is removed and the team's content is added to the DOM

                so make each team in the nav a button instead of an a link? 

                So ignore the table code below
        -->

        <div id="teamNav">

            <ul>
                <!--
                    In the .js file, for each team in the array of fave teams, 
                    add an <li><button></button></li> tot he DOMif that works - 
                    I've never used buttton sin an unordered list before
                -->
            </ul>

        </div><!--end teamNav-->


        <div id="teamNav">
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Team 1</li>
                    <li>Team 2</li>
                    <li>Team3</li>
                </ul>

                <!--
                    for each team in the data, add a td to the table. 
                    Idk how we'll do tr, maybe two teams per row? 
                    or we could just do a new tr for each team
                    This will be done in a js file, a for loop 
                    for the length of the array of teams
                    <tr><a><td></td></a><tr>

            <!--
                so on page load, have a default page that says one of two things:
                    -if the player has no fave teams, then the nav list will be blank and the content will say "got to Add Teeams (a page) to choose your favorite teams"
                    -show the list of teams on  the left, and on the content display: "Select a team to view its statisitics."
